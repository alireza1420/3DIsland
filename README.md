## 🧭 Overview

**3DIsland** is a fully interactive, **3D web portfolio** that turns your personal or professional showcase into an immersive experience.  
Instead of scrolling through flat pages, visitors can explore a **3D island environment** — making your portfolio both technically impressive and memorable.

## 🎯 Motivation

Most portfolios look the same — static grids and text sections.  
**3DIsland** was created to stand out: a dynamic, visually engaging website that reflects creativity, technical skill, and modern UI thinking.

It’s both a personal showcase and a demonstration of front-end engineering proficiency with **React**, **Vite**, and **Three.js (or similar 3D engine)**.
